# Simulations

To perform the simulations, we used the TADphys package, which you can download from [here](https://github.com/cavallifly/TADphys) and install using the instructions therein.

To prepare the simulations with 1 and 20 chains, you can launch the following command from the Simulation folder:


```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

<html>
      <head>
        cd Modelling_setup
        bash ./scripts/Modelling_setup.sh
      </head>
    </html>
