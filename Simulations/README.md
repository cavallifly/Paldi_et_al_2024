# Simulations

To perform the simulations, we used the TADphys package, which you can download from [here](https://github.com/cavallifly/TADphys) and install using the instructions therein.

To prepare the simulations with 1 and 20 chains, you can launch the following command from the Simulation folder:


```bash
cd Modelling_setup
bash ./scripts/Modelling_setup.sh
```
